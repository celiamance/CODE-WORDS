# Visualisation - Week 08
## Level Visualiser
![sound](waves_screen.png)

In last weeks class we were shown through how to recieve a input level from a song or song using p5.Amplitude, using this number we were then told to experiment and have fun with it over the next week. I played around with creating a sin wave pattern while using the amplitude of the song, [*Skee Mask - Kozmic Flush*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zf42fwPnag&ab_channel=ILIANTAPE), to change  the lines thickness and colour to create a hypnotising effect. I think the use of the p5.js sound library will play a major role in my upcoming major assignment mainly to create an immersive atmosphere but I think it would also be interesting to see how else sound can be used to create an interactive experience. You can use the visualiser for yourself [*here*](https://fergarundel.github.io/CODE-WORDS/week_08/waves/).

## Frequency Visualiser

Continuing on from using the Amplitude as a value in my sketch, I explored using FFT, [Fast Fourier transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform), as a method to create visually appealing outcomes. Using a video from [*The Coding Train*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O3nm0Nvbi4&t=1s&ab_channel=TheCodingTrain) as a template [*my outcome*](https://fergarundel.github.io/CODE-WORDS/week_08/waves2/), as shown above, is quite basic and rudimentary in terms of what can be achieved using this function. I will also continue to experiment with this in the future as  a way to create interaction between visual and audio elements.

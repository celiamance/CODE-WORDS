# Visualisation - Week 08
## Sound Visualiser
![sound](waves_screen.png)

In last weeks class we were shown through how to recieve a input level from a song or song using p5.Amplitude, using this number we were then told to experiment and have fun with it over the next week. I played around with creating a sin wave pattern while using the amplitude of the song, [*Skee Mask - Kozmic Flush*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zf42fwPnag&ab_channel=ILIANTAPE), to change  the lines thickness and colour to create a hypnotising effect. I think the use of the p5.js sound library will play a major role in my upcoming major assignment mainly to create an immersive atmosphere but I think it would also be interesting to see how else sound can be used to create an interactive experience. You can use the visualiser for yourself [*here*](https://fergarundel.github.io/CODE-WORDS/week_08/waves/).
